*Add Lovecraftian monsters to your RimWorld experience!* There is a lingering fear that strokes the hairs on the back of the necks of your colonists. Something terrible is coming, and there is little time to prepare. Cosmic horrors are already upon us.
	
[h1]Features:[/h1]
This is an attempt to create the minor races of H.P. Lovecraft's weird fiction mythos in the RimWorld engine. Some behave the same as hostile factions that raid colonies such as mechanoids or insectoids. Others can be deadlier, however.

Adds the following cosmic horrors to your game:
[list]
[*]Star-Spawn of Cthulhu
[*]Shoggoths
[*]Mi-Go
[*]Deep Ones
[*]Star Vampire
[*]Dark Young
[*]Chthonian

[h1]Notes:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Each monster has its own unique anatomical skeletons, organs, and body parts. Some special powers were given to psionic beasts.
[*]Each monster has special sound effects.
[*]More creatures will be added in a second update in the near future. A third update will flesh out these cosmic horrors with true special abilities true to their literary counterparts.
[*]Since I am one person, I can't attest to how balanced the monsters are, and I am definitely looking for feedback from player experiences. Let me know how they are in your game.
